<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  As a data analyst with a strong background in computer science, holding both a
  bachelor’s and a master’s degree, I’ve spent the majority of my career
  immersed in data. From uncovering patterns to providing insights that drive
  decision-making, data analysis has been my expertise. I’ve always been
  passionate about working with data, transforming complex datasets into
  actionable information.

  However, as technology continues to evolve, I’ve found myself intrigued by web
  development. The web is such a dynamic space, and I realized that learning to
  build and design websites would not only expand my skill set but also open new
  avenues in my career. I believe that understanding the structure behind the
  websites I interact with and the ability to create interactive, user-friendly
  platforms will enhance my work as a data analyst, particularly when
  integrating data visualization and dashboards into web interfaces.

  Learning web development is both exciting and challenging. With my foundation
  in programming, picking up languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been a
  natural progression, though it’s definitely a different way of thinking
  compared to data analysis. Still, I see the potential of combining these
  skills in the future to create more comprehensive solutions.
